                  We propose a novel obfuscation technique that can be used to
                  outsource hard satisffability (SAT) formulas to the cloud.
                  Servers with large computational power are typically used to
                  solve SAT instances that model real-life problems in task
                  scheduling, AI planning and circuit veriffcation. However,
                  outsourcing data to the cloud may lead to privacy and
                  information breaches since satisfying assignments may reveal
                  considerable information about the underlying problem modeled
                  by SAT. In this work, we develop a structure-aware obfuscation
                  framework that is similar to Indistinguishability Obfuscation.
                  At the core of the framework lies an automorphism mechanism
                  that transforms any formula to a random one with the same
                  number of satisfying assignments. Hence obfuscated formulas
                  are indistinguishable from each other thus preserving the
                  input-output privacy of the original SAT instance. Contrary to
                  prior solutions that are rather adhoc in nature, we formally
                  prove the security of our scheme. Additionally, we show that
                  the size of obfuscated formulas are within a factor n of the
                  original ones thus achieving polynomial slowdown. Finally, the
                  whole process is very efficient in practice, allowing
                  solutions to original instances to be easily recovered from
                  obfuscated ones. Our experimental evaluation shows the
                  feasibility and generality of our approach which makes it
                  ideal for real world applications.

                  The emergence of cloud computing gave users the capability to
                  offload computations that cannot be executed locally to cloud
                  servers with large computational power. One such
                  computationally demanding problem is solving large
                  satisfiability (SAT) instances. Although many problems from
                  AI, circuit verification, etc. can be converted to SAT,
                  outsourcing SAT instances may leak considerable information
                  that can put a user's security at risk. Hence the privacy of
                  outsourcing computations to the cloud is a major issue. In
                  this work we look at the techniques of Qin et al. (Qin and
                  Jia., 2014; Qin and Du., 2018) which have been used to
                  obfuscate SAT formulas before they are released to the cloud.
                  We came up with a realistic attack against their technique
                  that demonstrates how a malicious cloud provider can obtain
                  significant information about the underlying SAT instance. Our
                  work shows that ad hoc schemes cannot offer the required
                  security guarantees for outsourcing SAT computations, hence
                  more formal frameworks should be used instead.

                  IoT interoperability is a major challenge in the emerging IoT
                  field. This paper introduces a novel and light weighted
                  language for the IoT devices to use. TON (Things Object
                  Notation) is a language which was built on top of JSON
                  (JavaScript Object Notation) to accommodate the needs of IoTs'
                  interoperability. This research improves two aspects of JSON
                  (1) compactness and (2) commanding. Currently, a lot of
                  communicational pollution such as wireless data and noise
                  emerge from the explosion of the IoTs. Thus, a minimum
                  information/data is needed to be sent. In addition, since most
                  practitioners are hobbyists, a one language/protocol that
                  passes information and commands will be more convenient.
                  Further, this study provides three use cases and shows
                  comparison between using JSON and TON as a mean to send data
                  and information.
